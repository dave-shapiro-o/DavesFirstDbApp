# AnotherDbTest
My first functional sql server database console app. Performs C.R.U.D. operations and displays data. 
Incorporating speech synthesis, voice can be auditioned and selected from available installed voices.
The data display is specific to my 2 databases, but the server and default voice are selected from args[].
